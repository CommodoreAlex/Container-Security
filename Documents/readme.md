# Container Security Documentation – Concepts & Theory

## Overview
This folder contains high-level documentation on **containerization concepts and theory**.  
It is intended to give readers a foundational understanding of how containers work, why they exist, and the principles that underpin container security.

These documents are **tool-agnostic** and provide the conceptual basis before diving into platform-specific guidance (Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, Rancher, etc.) or security hardening.
